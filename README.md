# eGovStack
eGov stack is a set of loosely related software modules that we hope enables any government initiative or project to quickly setup effective goal and milestone assignment, tracking, monitoring and review.

Each module will be usable stand-alone as part of your workflow. Alternatively, you can download and use sample projects which will be released periodically which tie relevant modules together to solve particular use cases.

All the modules are part of the bigger eGov open source OS for governance - a community initiative by Samagra.

### Use Cases:
