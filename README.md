# eGovStack
eGov stack is a set of loosely related software modules that we hope enables any government initiative or project to quickly setup effective goal and milestone assignment, tracking, monitoring and review.

Each module will be usable stand-alone as part of your workflow. Alternatively, you can download and use sample projects which will be released periodically which tie relevant modules together to solve particular use cases.

All the modules are part of the bigger eGov open source OS for governance - a community initiative by Samagra.

### Use Cases: 

#### Dashboard module

Governments and enterprises across the world are integrating data based solutions with their workstreams to increase efficiency and quality of operation. Annual reports are seeing a shift in trend from being demonstrative to statistical. MIS and analytics have emerged as an independent domain of specialization as well as profession. Citizens across the world are evaluating customer services at various levels and are adopting of web and mobile based applications. Every one of these interactions give rise to more data.

Given the availability of field data, coupled with the focus of the governments on citizen welfare and bias for results, actionable analytics can play a pivotal role in reshaping decision making. From head of state level goal to task assignment of the field officer, everything can be linked by data. This will enable anyone to monitor progress with granular detail and most importantly perform root cause analysis at every stage. Several of these operations can also be made intelligent with recent advances in actionable analytics with machine learning and AI.

With e-Gov stack, a junior developer in a Health Ministry will be able to build a dashboard that gives the Prime Minister live citizen feedback on the latest health emergency in less than a day.  It will take another few hours to build in functionality for citizens in affected areas to receive notifications tailored to the risks they face. The result: Better understanding, better decisions and saved lives.

### Vision: 

#### Shaping the governments of tomorrow, together. 

We envisage a future where decisions which impact millions of lives can be taken in seconds or minutes rather than weeks or months; where the best in class technology is freely available to any government anywhere in the world; and where that technology is built by citizens themselves.
